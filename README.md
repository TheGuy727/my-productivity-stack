# My productivity stack
My productivity stack for workflow transcendence. 

Have suggestions? Submit an issue, especially for the following: general file explorer, SFTP client.

## Software
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - Clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins. Development discontinued but works well.
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - Window manager
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot power tool, can edit/blur and upload directly to image sharing sites.
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - General text/code editor, check [##Development](#development) for my current IDE.
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - Task manager for power users, drop-in replacement.
- [**SoundSwitch**](https://github.com/Belphemur/SoundSwitch/) - switch default playing device
- [**Negative Screen**](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen) - dim or invert your screen for those late night code sessions
- [**IrfanView**](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Image viewer, initally released in 1996 and still in active development.
- [**VirtualCloneDrive**](https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html) (Windows 7) - Load ISO files directly, newer versions of Windows have this built-in.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications
- [**Bulk Rename Utility**](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk) - advanced file renamer
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Animated screen recording to GIF. Alternatively - [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/).

#### [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) Scripts
- [**Launch Calculator**](Launch%20Calculator.ahk) - allows only a single instance of a calculator to be launched. Bound to calc key.

## Support/Diagnostic
- [**WizTree**](http://antibody-software.com) - Disk space visualizer, stupid fast.
- [**HWiNFO**](https://hwinfo.com) - Comprehensive hardware analysis/monitoring
- [**SpeedFan**](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php) - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures
- [**CPU-Z**](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Hardware identification
- [**Driver Identifier**](https://www.driveridentifier.com/) - find newer system drivers if absolutely necessary.
- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.

## Development
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**WinSCP**](https://winscp.net) - SFTP client
- [**Laravel Valet (Windows port)**](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows) - PHP/Laravel development environment.

## Personal taste
- [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com) - Cloud storage
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrates with YTDL.
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - a tiny sound player, I use it to preview audio and listen to single tracks. Most importantly it plays old school tracker music!
- [**CDisplayEx**](http://www.cdisplayex.com/) - Image viewer for zip and comics.
- [**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org) - Extremely customizable torrenting application.
- [**Rainmeter**](https://www.rainmeter.net/) - Displays info on desktop. I use it for my [World Clock](https://github.com/alystair/rainmeterWorldclock) and edited version of [Do I need a Jacket 2.0](https://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Do-I-Need-a-Jacket-2-0-beta-2016-04-10-494721790)
- [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) - Streaming and recording software
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks

## Retired
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Scroll unfocused windows. Replaced by DisplayFusions, will probably return to it or [WizMouse](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/).
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page update monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates. Likely to be replaced by a Chrome extension.
- [**MediaMonkey**](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Absolutely incredible media library software. Highly customizable. When my media disks and backup failed catastrophically years ago I never had the time to get things back in order. Maybe I will someday, I enjoyed rating music I listened to on a 0-5 scale which online services can't do.
