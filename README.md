My productivity stack for workflow trancendance. Submit an issue if you have suggestions!

## Software
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - Clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins. Development discontinued but works well.
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - Window manager
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot power tool, can edit/blur and upload directly to image sharing sites.
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - General text/code editor, check [##Development](#development) for my current IDE.
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - Task manager for power users, drop-in replacement.
- [**Negative Screen**](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen) - dim or invert your screen for those late night code sessions
- [**IrfanView**](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Image viewer, initally released in 1996 and still in active development.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications
- [**Bulk Rename Utility**](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk) - advanced file renamer
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Animated screen recording to GIF. I might replace it with, [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/).

## Hardware
- [**WizTree**](http://antibody-software.com) - Disk space visualizer, stupid fast.
- [**HWiNFO**](https://hwinfo.com) - Comprehensive hardware analysis/monitoring
- [**SpeedFan**](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php) - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures
- [**CPU-Z**](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Hardware identification
- [**Driver Identifier**](https://www.driveridentifier.com/) - find newer system drivers if absolutely necessary.
- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) (not Explorer!) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.

## Development

## Personal taste
- [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com) - Cloud storage
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrates with YTDL.
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - a tiny sound player, I use it to preview audio and listen to single tracks. Most importantly it plays old school tracker music!

## Physical gear

## Retired / Looking to replace

- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page update monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates.
