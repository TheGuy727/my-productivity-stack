# workflow
My current application stack for optimal workflow under Windows

## Dailys
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - an ancient clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins.
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - Window manager
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot tool
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - replacement Task Manager for power users.
- [**Negative Screen**](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen) - dim or invert your screen for those late night code sessions
- [**IrfanView**](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Image viewer, initally released in 1996 and still in active development.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications
- [**Bulk Rename Utility**](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk) - advanced file renamer
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Animated screen recording to GIF


## Hardware
- [**WizTree**](http://antibody-software.com) - Disk space visualizer, stupid fast.
- [**Driver Identifier**](https://www.driveridentifier.com/) - find newer system drivers if absolutely necessary.
- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) (not Explorer!) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.

## Development
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**WinSCP**](https://winscp.net) - SFTP client

## Personal taste
- [**Dropbox**](https://winscp.net) - Cloud storage
- [**Rainmeter**]() - Displays info on desktop. I use it for my [World Clock]() and edited version of [Do I need a Jacket 2.0]()
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - a tiny sound player, I use it to preview audio and listen to single tracks. Most importantly it plays old school tracker music!
- [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) - Streaming and recording software
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks

## Physical
- [**Zebra F-701 ballpoint Pen**](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/)
- Measuring tape - used way more often than one would think
- Label printer

## Retired
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Replaced by DisplayFusions, will probably return to it or WizMouse.
