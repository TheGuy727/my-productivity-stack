# My productivity stack
My productivity stack for workflow transcendence. Ordered by blend of usage/usefulness.

Have suggestions? Submit an issue, especially for the following: general file explorer, SFTP client, Adobe Fireworks.

## Software
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - Clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins. Development discontinued but works well.

- [**WizMouse**](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/) (Win 7) - Allows mouse wheel to work on window under the cursor, even if it's out of focus.
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot power tool, can edit/blur and upload directly to image sharing sites.
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - General text/code editor, check [##Development](#development) for my current IDE.
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password/private data manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - Task manager for power users, drop-in replacement.

#### [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) Scripts
- [**Launch Calculator**](Launch%20Calculator.ahk) - allows only a single instance of a calculator to be launched. Bound to calc key.
- [~~**Audio Switcher**~~](Change%20Audio.ahk) - replaced by SoundSwitch. File still available for reference.

## Media / Creation
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - Tiny audio player. Also [grab this skin](http://support.xmplay.com/files_view.php?file_id=557) because the default design is very ugly. It plays [old school tracker music](https://modarchive.org) and has plugins for game console sound files! 
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrates with YoutubeDL.
- [**Adobe Fireworks**](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/fireworks.html) - Discontinued bitmap/vector editing tool. The ultimate compromise between Photoshop and Illustrator.
- [**Adobe Audition**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Defacto in audio editing/recording.
- [**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Free & open source multi-track audio editing/recording. Mostly use Adobe Audition.
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Animated screen recording to GIF. The outputed GIFs are very optimal.

- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.

## Physical gear
- **Headphones** - [Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro](https://www.beyerdynamic.com) 80ohm headphones - closed reference headphones with soft pads & readily available replacement pads/parts (Beyerdynamic rarely discontinues models unlike brands like Audio Technica).
- **Ballpoint pen** - [Zebra F-701 ballpoint Pen](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/)
- **Measuring tape** - Used way more often than one would think!
- **Label printer** - [Dymo](http://www.dymo.com) LabelWriter

## Retired
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Scroll unfocused windows. Replaced by [WizMouse](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/).
- [**ScreenToGif**](http://www.screentogif.com/) - replaced by LiceCAP.
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks. No longer change my wallpaper that much, although I do rarely use it to generate multi-monitor wallpaper.
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates. Likely to be replaced by a Chrome extension.
- [**MediaMonkey**](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Absolutely incredible media library software. Highly customizable. When my media disks and backup failed catastrophically years ago I never had the time to get things back in order. Maybe I will someday, I enjoyed rating music I listened to on a 0-5 scale which online services can't do.
